The word is derived the the Latin, `tessella`, a small cubical piece of clay, stone or glass used to make mosaics (from Wikipedia). \n\nThe Russian mathematician, from whose name the term `Voronoi` was coined, is Georgy Voronoy, shown in the picture.

Voronoi-like tessellations appeared in 1644 in the\nwork of Decartes on the distribution of matter in the cosmic region near our sun.\nThe first systematic treatment of what we now call Voronoi tessellations was given\nby Dirichlet (Dirichlet, 1850) in his study of two- and three-dimensional quadratic\nforms, i.e., homogeneous, multivariate polynomials of degree two; hence, Voronoi\nregions are often referred to as Dirichlet cells. Voronoi (Voronoi, 1907) generalized\nthe work of Dirichlet to arbitrary dimensions, again using what are now referred to\nas Voronoi tessellations or diagrams.\n\n#### A method with many names...\n> It is not surprising, due to their ubiquity and usefulness, that throughout the 20th\ncentury, **Voronoi tessellations** were rediscovered many times. As a result, Voronoi\nregions have been called by many different names. **Thiessen polygons** refer to the\nwork of Theissen on developing more accurate estimates for the average rainfall\nin a region. **Area of influence polygons** was a term coined in connection with the\nprocessing of data about ore distributions obtained from boreholes. **Wigner-Seitz regions**, domain of an atom, and **Meijering cells** were terms that arose from work on\ncrystal lattices and the Voronoi cell of the reciprocal crystal lattice is referred to as\nthe **Brillouin zone** (Kittel, 2004; Ziman, 1979). In the study of codes by, e.g., Shannon, Voronoi cells are called **maximum likelihood regions** (Weaver and Shannon,\n1963). The field of ecology gave rise to two more alternate labels: **area potentially\navailable** and **plant polygons** for a Voronoi region associated with a particular tree\nor plant. **Capillary domains** refers to Voronoi regions in a tissue based on the centers\nof capillaries.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"show_youtube('https://www.youtube.com/embed/65XBl7y9mSM', 800,500)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"execution_count":2,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.lib.display.IFrame at 0x7d9b39c2b1f0>","text/html":"\n        <iframe\n            width=\"800\"\n            height=\"500\"\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/65XBl7y9mSM\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen\n            \n        ></iframe>\n        "},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### More uses","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.
